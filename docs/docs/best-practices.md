# Best Practices

The fairhub.io platform is designed to follow the best practices for developing AI-READI applications. This ensures that we are complying with the [FAIR4RS principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x/), and that our applications are interoperable with other AI-READI applications.

To learn more about the best practices for developing AI-READI applications, please refer to the [AI-READI Best Practices](https://dev.aireadi.org) documentation.

# Checklist

The fairhub.io repository also contains a [checklist](https://github.com/AI-READI/dev.fairhub.io/blob/main/best-practices-assessment.md) that can be used to assess the compliance of our application with the best practices. Please update this checklist as you develop your application.
