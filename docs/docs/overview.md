# Overview

This documentation is a central repository for storing developer information on the fairhub.io project. It is intended to be used by the developer team for getting instructions on running, building, and releasing our projects.

This resource also provides the conventions the team should be using while working on AI-READI applications.

## About AI-READI

AI-READI is one of the data generation projects of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Bridge2AI Program. The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health.
